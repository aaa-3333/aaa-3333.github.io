    <h1><strong>Introduction</strong> </h1>
    <p>The art design of the Harry Potter films is also an important element in restoring the magical world. From architectural design to simple props, every detail has been carefully crafted. These films combine real-life effects, complex set design, and CGI to create an immersive visual experience. While using art skills, incorporating European art history and culture also makes the pictures more magical.</p>

    <h2><strong>Costume Design</strong></h2>
            <p>JK Rowling created hundreds of characters for Harry Potter; each of them has powerful descriptions of their personalities and appearances. Rowling defines each character through what they wear, and costume designers Judianna Makovsky, Lindy Hemming, and, for most of the films, Jany Temime took on the task of translating the characters to the big screen. They cleverly used Rowling's descriptions to externalize the characters through clothing.</p>

            <p>A typical example is the costume design for the character of Rita Skeeter. The three-dimensional tailoring and sharp-cut women's suits show her sharp and sarcastic characteristics, and the fur is used to show her shrewdness and selfishness.</p>

            <p>In addition to costumes, various hats not only modify the actor's facial shape and serve as part of the wizard's costume, but also play the role of expressing the character's personality.</p>

            <p>The staff made more than 25,000 costumes for this series of films. The school uniforms used the representative colors of the college, combining the British school uniforms with the characteristics of wizard costumes in European legends. During the filming, for the realism of campus life, the actors were allowed to match their own clothes and wear their own clothes when they did not need to wear uniforms.</p>

            <h2><strong>Use of Classical Art</strong></h2>
            <p>In addition to original artistic visual expressions, the Harry Potter series of films also contains many tributes to classic works of art.</p>

            <img src="https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Vitruvian-Man--e1663167109711.jpeg" width="500px" height="500px">
            <p>For example, in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the image of a werewolf flashing on a projector displayed by Professor Severus Snape is inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.</p>
            <img src="https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Anne-Boleyn-in-Harry-Potter-scaled-e1663168307994-1536x926.jpg" width="350px" height="250px">
            <img src="https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-14-at-11.21.46-AM-1184x1536.png" width="350px" height="450px">
            <p>Many oil paintings were used in the film's lobby and corridor settings, one of which was an unaltered portrait of Anne Boleyn, the second queen of Henry VIII.</p>
            <p>According to Harry Potter fans, the use of Anne Boleyn's portrait in the movies makes sense because she was accused of being a witch during her lifetime but turned out to be a Squib. But even her husband Henry declared that he was "bewitched" by her beauty and charm. So, that's why she is hung on the wall of Hogwarts along with other witches and wizards.</p>

            <p>A replica of the Unicorn Tapestry shows the captive unicorn that appears in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The real tapestry is currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Cloisters in New York City, but this model looks identical to the original.</p>
