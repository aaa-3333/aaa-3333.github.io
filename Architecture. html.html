            <h2><strong>Real Scene</strong></h2>
            <p>The Harry Potter films are brought to life through stunning real locations and intricate studio sets. Many iconic scenes were filmed across the UK, blending authentic historical sites with movie magic.</p>

            <p>When it comes to the actual filming locations, King's Cross Station is one of the most iconic. At the beginning of each school year, Harry and his friends had to pass through Platform 9 3/4 at King's Cross Station to catch the Hogwarts Express. If you visit King's Cross today, you can find the set of Platform 9 3/4 and take a photo with the trolley that runs through the wall.</p>

            <p>For example, the Romanesque church of Durham Cathedral and the Gothic architecture of Gloucester Cathedral provided a lot of reference and inspiration for the interior and exterior architectural design of Hogwarts in the movie, providing a fulcrum for Hogwarts' magical architectural style that has the characteristics of each era.</p>

            <p>Many of the film's exteriors, especially the Hogwarts campus scenes, were filmed in the Scottish Highlands. These include the village of Hogsmeade, Black Lake and other scenes that have some features from the Scottish Highlands.</p>
            <p>Also, the Hogwarts Express runs along the actual Jacobite steam train line. The film shows the train running on the real-life Glenfinnan Viaduct.</p>

            <h2><strong>Architectural Design</strong></h2>
            <p>In addition to the real-life shooting, Stuart Craig's creative ideas and the wonderful architectural design that combines various architectural styles with modern art are also a highlight of the film.</p>
            <img src="https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/A4339-The-Wizarding-World-meets-Architectural-world-IMG-10.jpeg.webp" width="400px" height="300px">
            <p>Stuart Craig would start by creating an initial sketch or "doodle". After refining it with the Director, the Concept Artist would create a full concept map for all departments to use as further inspiration for their designs. After approval, the Art Department would create floor plans and elevations for the construction team to use to build the set. When needed, a white card mock-up was made to ensure the Director was happy with the design, and also so they could plan their camera angles using a lipstick camera. After approval at each stage of planning, the set was finally built.</p>

            <img src="https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MC-Escher-.jpeg" width="400px" height="300px">
            <p>The criss-crossing moving staircases are a highlight of the Hogwarts building interior, and the visual effect of restoring them was inspired by M.C. Escher's 1953 graphic design "Relativity", which is his most famous work and has been reproduced thousands of times. At first, the two ends of the stairs seem to never meet, but on closer inspection, they meet in an "impossible shape". The geometric mystery of the stairs in this painting is a perfect match for Hogwarts. The filmmakers' interpretation of the movable staircase expanded on Escher's graphic and used CGI technology to perfectly present it in three dimensions.</p>
